      <p>
        I am currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://ecse.rpi.edu" target="_blank">Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering</a>,
        <a href="https://www.rpi.edu" target="_blank">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>, 
        and am fortunately advised by
        <a href="https://chentianyi1991.github.io" target="_blank">Prof.&nbsp;Tianyi Chen</a>.  
        Prior to that, I was a visiting student at the Data & Computer Science Department of 
                <a href="https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/Academics/Schools___Departments.htm" target="_blank">Sun Yat‑Sen University</a> (2020‑2021),
        hosted by <a href="http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~qingling/" target="_blank">Prof.&nbsp;Qing Ling</a>.  
        I earned my B.S. in Statistics from <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> in 2020.

      <p>At the core of my research is the question: <strong>How can optimization shape the next generation of AI?</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio‑focus">
      <p>I focus on optimization and machine learning, particularly <strong>bilevel</strong> and <strong>multi‑objective optimization</strong> to develop provably efficient algorithms that advance two key frontiers of AI:</p>
      <ul class="frontiers">
        <li><strong>Generative Models</strong>: LLMs, diffusion models</li>
        <li><strong>Next‑Generation AI Computing</strong>: emerging analog devices</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="bio‑closing">
      <p>My goal is to bridge theory and practice, making AI models more powerful, efficient, and scalable while designing algorithms tailored for emerging AI hardware computing architectures.</p>
