      <p>
        I am currently a PhD student in <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/ece/" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, 
        based at the <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell Tech Campus</a> in New York City, 
        and am fortunately advised by
        <a href="https://chentianyi1991.github.io" target="_blank">Prof.&nbsp;Tianyi Chen</a>.  
        Prior to that, I have spent four years at the <a href=https://ecse.rpi.edu target='_blank'>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> and transferred with my advisor.  
        I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics from <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> in 2020.

    <div class="bio‑highlight">
      <p>At the core of my research is the question: <strong>How can optimization shape the next generation of AI?</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio‑focus">
      <p>I focus on optimization and machine learning, particularly <strong>bilevel</strong> and <strong>multi‑objective optimization</strong> to develop provably efficient algorithms that advance two key frontiers of AI:</p>
      <ul class="frontiers">
        <li><strong>Generative Models</strong>: multimodal large language models, diffusion models</li>
        <li><strong>Next‑Generation AI Computing</strong>: emerging energy-efficient analog devices</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="bio‑closing">
      <p>My goal is to bridge theory and practice, making AI models more efficient and scalable while designing algorithms tailored for emerging AI hardware computing architectures.</p>
